          the parties are not in agreement as to the change in Contract Price, or whether the term(s) or work constitute a change. {COMPANY_NAME}'s

          of the home improvement. Any Change Order forms for changes or extra work shall be incorporated in, and become a part of the contract. However, 
          in the event that the building department or the governing body requires a change or modification then {COMPANY_NAME} may make that 
          change prior to receiving written authorization and thereafter negotiate the effect of that change with the Owner. Payments for extra work will

          additional layers or roof removal etc.) will be addressed with the owner before continuing.
