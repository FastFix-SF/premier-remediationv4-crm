    by both the Owner and ${COMPANY_LEGAL_NAME}. The change in the Contract Price caused by such Change Order shall be agreed to in writing, or if

    of the home improvement. Any Change Order forms for changes or extra work shall be incorporated in, and become a part of the contract. However,

    change prior to receiving written authorization and thereafter negotiate the effect of that change with the Owner. Payments for extra work will
    be made as extra work progress, concurrently with progress payments. Any modification or addition after starting the roof (i.e. wood replacement,

    Owner hereby represents that Owner has no knowledge of the existence on or in any portion of the premises affected by the Project of any asbestos,
    lead paint, mold (including all types of microbial matter or microbiological contamination, mildew of fungus, or other hazardous materials). Testing
    for the existence of mold and other hazardous materials shall only be performed as expressly stated in writing. Contractor shall not be testing or
    performing any work whatsoever in an area that is not identified in the Scope of Work.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12px;">
    Unless the contract specifically calls for the removal, disturbance, or transportation of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), mold, lead paint,
    or other hazardous substances or materials, the parties acknowledge that such work requires special procedures, precautions, and/or licenses. Therefore,
    unless the contract specifically calls for same, if Contractor encounters such substance, Contractor shall immediately stop work and allow the Owner

    option. Said work will be treated as an extra under this contract, and the Contract Term setting forth the time for completion of the project may be delayed.

    of mold and microbial contamination, Contractor shall not be responsible for any recurring incidents of mold or microbial contamination appearing in the

    indemnify Contractor harmless for any occurrence or recurrence of mold or microbial contamination. Owner also agrees that Contractor shall not be
    responsible, and agrees to hold Contractor harmless and indemnify Contractor, for the existence of mold or microbial contamination in any area that
    Contractor was not contracted to test and/or remediate. Further, Owner is hereby informed, and hereby acknowledges, that most insurers expressly disclaim
    coverage for any actual or alleged damages arising from mold or microbial contamination. Contractor makes no representations whatsoever as to coverage for
    mold contamination, though at Owner's additional expense, if requested in writing, Contractor will inquire as to the availability of additional coverage
    for such contamination or remediation, and if available, will obtain such coverage if the additional premium is paid for by Owner as an extra.

    Contractor shall be deemed to have substantially commenced work at the earlier of (1) the time materials or equipment are delivered to the jobsite, or
    (2) the time removal or modification for any existing roof covering begins. Contractor's failure to substantially commence work within 20 days from the
    approximate date specified on the Agreement is a violation of the Contractor's License Law and buyer shall have the right to cancel this contract unless
    the Contractor has a legal excuse for such delay. The Contractor shall be excused for any delay in starting or completion of the contract caused by acts
    of God, acts of the owner or the owner's agent, employee or independent contractor, stormy weather, labor trouble, acts of public utilities, public bodies
    or inspectors extra work, failure of the owner to make progress payments promptly, or other contingencies unforeseeable by or beyond the reasonable control

const MECHANICS_LIEN_WARNING_TEMPLATE = `
<div class="mechanics-lien-page" style="page-break-before: always; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.4;">
  <h3 style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 15px;">MECHANICS LIEN WARNING:</h3>
  <p>
    Anyone who helps improve your property, but who is not paid, may record what is called a mechanics lien on your property.
    A mechanics lien is a claim, like a mortgage or home equity loan, made against your property and recorded with the county recorder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even if you pay your contractor in full, unpaid subcontractors, suppliers, and laborers who helped to improve your property
    may record mechanics liens and sue you in court to foreclose the lien. If a court finds the lien is valid, you could be forced
    to pay twice or have a court officer sell your home to pay the lien. Liens can also affect your credit.
  </p>
  <p>
    To preserve their right to record a lien, each subcontractor and material supplier must provide you with a document called a
    'Preliminary Notice.' This notice is not a lien. The purpose of the notice is to let you know that the person who sends you
    the notice has the right to record a lien on your property if he or she is not paid.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>BE CAREFUL.</strong> The Preliminary Notice can be sent up to 20 days after the subcontractor starts work or the supplier
    provides material. This can be a big problem if you pay your contractor before you have received the Preliminary Notices.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will not get Preliminary Notices from your prime contractor or other persons you contract with directly or from laborers who
    work on your project. The law assumes that you already know they are improving your property.
  </p>

  <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">PROTECT YOURSELF FROM LIENS.</h4>
  <p>
    You can protect yourself from liens by getting a list from your contractor of all the subcontractors and material suppliers that
    work on your project. Find out from your contractor when these subcontractors started work and when these suppliers delivered goods
    or materials. Then wait 20 days, paying attention to the Preliminary Notices you receive.
  </p>

  <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">PAY WITH JOINT CHECKS.</h4>
  <p>
    One way to protect yourself is to pay with a joint check. When your contractor tells you it is time to pay for the work of a
    subcontractor or supplier who has provided you with a Preliminary Notice, write a joint check payable to both the contractor and
    the subcontractor or material supplier.
  </p>
  <p>
    For other ways to prevent liens, visit CSLB's Web site at www.cslb.ca.gov or call CSLB at 800-321-CSLB (2752).
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 15px;">
    REMEMBER, IF YOU DO NOTHING, YOU RISK HAVING A LIEN PLACED ON YOUR HOME. This can mean that you may have to pay twice, or face
    the forced sale of your home to pay what you owe.
